This is an archive of some terrible old code from back when Diegoisawesome was a C noob. As it currently stands, this WILL NOT COMPILE. Some major refactoring needs to be done in order to have this compile and insert into any ROM besides a specially-crafted copy of CrystalDust. However, some people have requested that the latest version of this code be uploaded to GitHub in order to create custom menus themselves so hopefully this is satisfactory.

Not included are the map image files as those are for use in CrystalDust only.

REPEAT: THIS WILL NOT WORK AS IS. THIS IS ONLY FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES.
